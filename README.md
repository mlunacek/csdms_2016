# CSDMS 2016

Notebooks for the CSDMS annual meeting May, 2016

## Python Data Tools

### Setup

I would install the latest python package from [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).  This should have everything you need to run the notebook examples.  You can even consider using [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html).

Here are the commands you will need to execute to install the packages for this session:

    conda install jupyter
    conda install matplotlib
    conda install pandas
    conda install scikit-learn
    conda install cytoolz
    
For the **Dask** example, you'll also need:

    conda install dask
    conda install h5py
    conda install pil
    
    pip install graphviz

If you'd like to play with some of the visualization libraries, please also install these:

    conda install seaborn
    conda install bokeh
    conda install mpld3

    pip install plotly
    pip install cufflinks
    pip install ggplot
